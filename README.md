The purpose of these exercises is to give learners the opportunity to develop their Python skills through solving challenges that represent a wide spectrum of typical coding problems. There are two versions of these exercises:

1. The standard solutions: [standard exercises and solutions](./exercises.md);  
1. Object Oriented Programming solutions: [OOP exercises and solutions](./OOP.md).

The difference between the two documents is that the object oriented document provides an OOP solution to the same problems of the standard document. This will enable learners to compare the two approaches and become fluent in both.
